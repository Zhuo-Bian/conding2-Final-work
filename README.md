# conding2-Final-work
This work uses a computer camera to capture the picture, and rewrites the information of the picture to produce a wavy effect.

I use cv2, numpy, math, and matplotlib, respectively, which make my job much easier.

The program calls the computer's camera, flips the image left and right and outputs the current image every second, making it a stop-motion animation.
It then reads the data from each image and makes it look like an ocean wave by moving the pixels along the X and Y axes.Finally, output the picture.
